				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Agung Andre, most commonly known as Andre. I am a student
					who has a passion for programming and design. The programming field
					that interests me is the development of web apps, android, and games
					(which I studied are web based games). At the age of 16, when the
					pandemic hit and the students were learning from home, I began to
					learn many things self-taught, such as 2d and 3d animation, learning
					several programming languages such as python, javascript (and
					typescript), java, dart, and c. After I graduated from high school, I
					continued my studies at the Ganesha University of Education majoring
					in Informatics Engineering.
